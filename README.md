# MagicMushroom-dll
The source code of the dll that is required for <a href="https://github.com/PoseidonPhoenix/SpaceCheatMode">SpaceCheatMode</a> to run properly which includes a lot of functionality

## WARNINGS

- The pointers are all outdated, since this project is very old. So you have to find the new ones and update them in order for it to work
- You need to build this in x86 mode in order for it to work (since Among Us is a 32 bit process)

Again, the code is bad since this is the first project I have ever done.
